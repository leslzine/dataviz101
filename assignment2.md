## The Quantified Self

The assignment for my 
[Data Visualization Class at the CUNY Graduate Center](https://github.com/dataviz-gc/intro-dataviz-summer18), taught by 
[Erin Daugherty](https://datadozen.com/about/) and 
[Michelle McSweeney](http://www.michelleamcsweeney.com/) was to visualize a 
[quantified self](http://quantifiedself.com/) project. 

### The Data: Background

I chose to work with data about my work as a librarian at Barnard College, a private, predominantly women's baccalaureate institution in New York City. As a librarian at Barnard, I have three specialties. I am the 
[Associate Director of Communications](https://twitter.com/barnlib), a 
[Personal Librarian](https://library.barnard.edu/profiles/jenna-freedman), and the 
[Zine Librarian](https://zines.barnard.edu/). This visualization shows the number of research consultations I gave, instruction sessions I led, and reference questions I responded to in the year 2017. I have data from December 2015-April 2018 that I am happy to share, but showing just the most recent year for which I have complete data seemed like it would give a good enough picture of how I divide my time, at least in those three areas, in a cleaner manner than including the other months. 

Please note that the consultations, instruction, and reference categories are most evocative of the Personal Librarian role. As AD for Communications I am responsible for event programming, outreach, and social media, as well as serving on the library's management team. As Zine Librarian the work I do cataloging zines, which I spend a full day on each week is not represented in the numbers, nor is the significant amount of professional work I do, including publishing in lay and scholarly outlets and presenting at conferences, universities, and other venues. 

#### The Research Question
ME: I am a slacker. 

ALSO ME: I am a driven workaholic. 

Both of these things feel true. But are they? What do I do all day? All week? Month? Year? 

Every month I complete a report at work, detailing the number of references questions I've handled, consultations, I've given, classes I've taught, researchers I've hosted, and more. In  these monthly reports I indicate which of my three work hats I was wearing during each action: communications, personal librarian, or zine librarian. It would be useful for me to know how much effort I am put into each part of my job as my library prepares to expand its resources and services in the new school year. What am I doing? How am I spending my time? Which hat gets the most wear?  

Furthermore, as I dig into the data, I am finding that doing so is providing an unexpected benefit: pleasure. Reminding myself of the research topics I get to consult on, the classes I get to teach in, and the zine projects I get to engage in makes me feel intensely happy about the students, faculty, zinesters, and librarians I work with. 

#### The Audience

In a quantified self project, I assume the audience is typically the self. In this case I think there is practical use in sharing my visualizations with my boss as she imagines how we may need to adapt my responsibilities when my library opens in its new space this fall, when she conducts my annual review, and generally when she communicates about library work to college administrators.
