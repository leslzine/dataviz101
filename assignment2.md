## The Quantified Self

The assignment for my 
[Data Visualization Class at the CUNY Graduate Center](https://github.com/dataviz-gc/intro-dataviz-summer18), taught by 
[Erin Daugherty](https://datadozen.com/about/) and 
[Michelle McSweeney](http://www.michelleamcsweeney.com/) was to visualize a 
[quantified self](http://quantifiedself.com/) project. 

### The Data: Background

I chose to work with data about my work as a librarian at Barnard College, a private, predominantly women's baccalaureate institution in New York City. As a librarian at Barnard, I have three specialties. I am the 
[Associate Director of Communications](https://twitter.com/barnlib), a 
[Personal Librarian](https://library.barnard.edu/profiles/jenna-freedman), and the 
[Zine Librarian](https://zines.barnard.edu/). This visualization shows the number of research consultations I gave, instruction sessions I led, and reference questions I responded to in the year 2017. I have data from December 2015-April 2018 that I am happy to share, but showing just the most recent year for which I have complete data seemed like it would give a good enough picture of how I divide my time, at least in those three areas, in a cleaner manner than including the other months. 

Please note that the consultations, instruction, and reference categories are most evocative of the Personal Librarian role. As AD for Communications I am responsible for event programming, outreach, and social media, as well as serving on the library's management team. As Zine Librarian the work I do cataloging zines, which I spend a full day on each week is not represented in the numbers, nor is the significant amount of professional work I do, including publishing in lay and scholarly outlets and presenting at conferences, universities, and other venues. 


Following is my blog post about what actually happened with this assignment. You can check out my original proposal and detailed documentation of my process in 
[this shared document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQBpKUrJ_JT9wRzthy6ZwirWoOHlRYixf4DQS6P8GN4XElzwkeEkyrLbmbhN23YFJJ6teG_6mOo2RKi/pub).

My research question started out being about school complaints in Brooklyn, compared by Community Board. Classmates, I got frustrated and gave up. I decided just to look at complaints coming from my two-block street in Brooklyn, using the 2015 data. 

My audience is me! Now I know better what bothers my neighbors, so they, too, will benefit from my knowledge. Noise! They hate noise!  

This visualization shows the top ten complaints on my street. I couldn't get it to sort by number of complaints, but I did manage to limit the set to complaints on my street and group "Crooke Avenue" and "Crooke Ave" complaints. 

All of the details are in my 
[shared doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQBpKUrJ_JT9wRzthy6ZwirWoOHlRYixf4DQS6P8GN4XElzwkeEkyrLbmbhN23YFJJ6teG_6mOo2RKi/pub) and on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/zinelib/status/1003008050729570305). 

The next steps would be sorting the complaints by volume and adding in the other years of data.
