## The Quantified Self

The assignment for my 
[Data Visualization Class at the CUNY Graduate Center](https://github.com/dataviz-gc/intro-dataviz-summer18), taught by 
[Erin Daugherty](https://datadozen.com/about/) and 
[Michelle McSweeney](http://www.michelleamcsweeney.com/) was to visualize a 
[quantified self](http://quantifiedself.com/) project. 

### The Data: Background

I chose to work with data about my work as a librarian at Barnard College, a private, predominantly women's baccalaureate institution in New York City. As a librarian at Barnard, I have three specialties. I am the 
[Associate Director of Communications](https://twitter.com/barnlib), a 
[Personal Librarian](https://library.barnard.edu/profiles/jenna-freedman), and the 
[Zine Librarian](https://zines.barnard.edu/). This visualization shows the number of research consultations I gave, instruction sessions I led, and reference questions I responded to in the year 2017. I have data from December 2015-April 2018 that I am happy to share, but showing just the most recent year for which I have complete data seemed like it would give a good enough picture of how I divide my time, at least in those three areas, in a cleaner manner than including the other months. 

Please note that the consultations, instruction, and reference categories are most evocative of the Personal Librarian role. As AD for Communications I am responsible for event programming, outreach, and social media, as well as serving on the library's management team. As Zine Librarian the work I do cataloging zines, which I spend a full day on each week is not represented in the numbers, nor is the significant amount of professional work I do, including publishing in lay and scholarly outlets and presenting at conferences, universities, and other venues.
