Following is my blog post about what actually happened with this assignment. You can check out my original proposal and detailed documentation of my process in 
[this shared document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQBpKUrJ_JT9wRzthy6ZwirWoOHlRYixf4DQS6P8GN4XElzwkeEkyrLbmbhN23YFJJ6teG_6mOo2RKi/pub).

My research question started out being about school complaints in Brooklyn, compared by Community Board. Classmates, I got frustrated and gave up. I decided just to look at complaints coming from my two-block street in Brooklyn, using the 2015 data. 

My audience is me! Now I know better what bothers my neighbors, so they, too, will benefit from my knowledge. Noise! They hate noise!  

This visualization shows the top ten complaints on my street. I couldn't get it to sort by number of complaints, but I did manage to limit the set to complaints on my street and group "Crooke Avenue" and "Crooke Ave" complaints. 

All of the details are in my 
[shared doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQBpKUrJ_JT9wRzthy6ZwirWoOHlRYixf4DQS6P8GN4XElzwkeEkyrLbmbhN23YFJJ6teG_6mOo2RKi/pub) and on

The next steps would be sorting the complaints by volume and adding in the other years of data.
