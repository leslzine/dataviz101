Following is my blog post about what actually happened with this assignment. You can check out my original proposal and detailed documentation of my process in 
[this shared document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQBpKUrJ_JT9wRzthy6ZwirWoOHlRYixf4DQS6P8GN4XElzwkeEkyrLbmbhN23YFJJ6teG_6mOo2RKi/pub).

My research question started out being about school complaints in Brooklyn, compared by Community Board. Classmates, I got frustrated and gave up. I decided just to look at complaints coming from my two-block street in Brooklyn, using the 2015 data. 

My audience is me! Now I know better what bothers my neighbors, so they, too, will benefit from my knowledge. Noise! They hate noise!  

This visualization 
A written description of your visualization. Explain your visualization in terms that a data novice would understand. Your goal is to make your work approachable. At this point in your post, anyone who has come across your site should understand what your research question is, why this topic matters to your audience, and how to read and interact with your visualization.
Your embedded visualization. Your visualization should be published on your Tableau Public Profile and embedded in your blog post. It should retain all the interactive functionality you built in Tableau.
An explanation of the data and design decisions you made. This section should illustrate what you did and why you did it. Why did you choose the type of chart/graph/visualization that you did? How does that choice best represent the data and address your question? Through this explanation, you will illustrate that the decisions you made were intentional and how they contribute to the project. You should also explain any limitations you encountered and any subsequent compromises you made with the data or your design.
Next steps. Finally, explain where you could take this project in the future. What would the immediate and more complex next steps look like? What improvements, developments, or alterations in scope would you make?
